# sCalc

Similar to [NaSC](https://github.com/parnold-x/nasc)

Uses Electron

Specific syntax (ie. graph y=x^2 would show a graph to the right of y=x^2, while zeros y=x^2 would output the zeros)

# Running it
Download the repository and run `npm start` to start the program. Packaged applications to come.


# Order of things to be completed
1. Basic GUI - get input from Electron GUI to process in some backend
2. Simple calculator (+, -, *, /, etc.)
3. Graph equations - interactive like Desmos?
4. Syntax for specific commands - instead of program asking question, user inputs something like "graph 2x"
5. Improvements on math commands
6. Move onto other subjects (physics, chemistry, etc.)


Use Wolfram Alpa or Desmos for graphing/computation?
