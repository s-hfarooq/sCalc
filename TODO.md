## Future improvements
1. GUI - make it look better - also needs line numbers on input/output
2. ~~Simple calculator (+, -, *, /, etc.)~~
3. ~~Graph equations - interactive like Desmos? - basic graph in program with link to Desmos below?~~ - still needs improvements, but basics working
4. Improvements on math commands - remove keywords and smartly detect what the user wants?
5. Improvements on GUI/tweaking small things - different text color/highlights for different "objects", theming options, etc.
6. Move onto other subjects (physics, chemistry, etc.)
